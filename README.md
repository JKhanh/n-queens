# n-queens

This program uses the hill climbing algorithm in order to find a solution for the N-Queens Problem.

N-Queens Problem:
```
Given an integer N > 3, place N queens in a NxN board in such a way that no
queen can attack another queen.
```

As heuristic cost for the algorithm, it was used the number of pair of queens that can attack each order.
